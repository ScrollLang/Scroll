test:
	assert "Hello <break>World!" = "Hello \nWorld!" with "'break'-tag failed"

	# Note that the '\t'-character is deemed to be successful.
	# This means that if the String test fails because of this character, this character will fail too!
	assert "Hello <tab>World!" = "Hello \tWorld!" with "'tab'-tag failed (if String test failed as well, fix that test first)"
