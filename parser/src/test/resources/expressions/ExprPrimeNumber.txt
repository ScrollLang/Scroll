test:
	set {var} to the 7th prime number

	# Note that this should not be a heavy task for the parser to find.
	# If the process time of this test is high, and you are reviewing it because of that,
	# it probably means that the prime finder-mechanism is not as efficient anymore.
	# Advised process time: under 0.300s
