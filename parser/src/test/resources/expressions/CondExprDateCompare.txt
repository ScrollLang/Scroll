test:
	set {list::1} to yesterday
	assert {list::1} wasn't more than 2 days ago with "{list::1} should not be more than 2 days ago: %{list::1}% - %now% (now)"

	set {list::2} to 3 hours later
	assert {list::2} was less than 1 second ago with "{list::2}, a future date, should be less than 1 second ago: %{list::2}% - %now% (now)"

	set {list::3} to 5 hours ago
	set {var} to 5 hours
	remove 1 millisecond from {var}
	assert {list::3} was more than {var} ago with "{list::3} should be more than 4:59:59.999 hours ago: %{list::3}% - %now% (now)"

	# This code took too long for the parser to load
	# I tried looking into it, but it seems that the syntax is just very cumbersome to handle.
	# assert {list::3} was more than (4 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds and 999 milliseconds) ago with "{list::3} should be more than 4:59:59.999 hours ago: %{list::3}% - %now% (now)"

	# Multiple dates
	assert {list::*} was less than 1 day and 3 minutes ago with "{list::*} should all be less than 1 day and 3 minutes ago"
