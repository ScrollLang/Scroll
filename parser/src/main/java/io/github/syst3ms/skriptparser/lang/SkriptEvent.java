/**
 * The entry point for all code in Skript. Once an event triggers, all of the code inside it may be run.
 *
 * Skript-parser's event system is composed of three interacting parts : {@link Trigger}, {@link SkriptEvent} and {@link TriggerContext}.
 * This is directly parallel to Skript's event system, with Bukkit's own Event class replacing TriggerContext.
 *
 * Let's explain how this system works using a simple analogy : skript-parser is like a giant kitchen :
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The goal is to prepare food (write code).</li>
 *   <li>There are many different types of food to prepare ({@link TriggerContext}s).</li>
 *   <li>There are different means of actually preparing the food (different {@link SkriptEvent}s), each one being specific to one or more types of food</li>
 *   <li>Finally, in order to make the recipe come together, one needs the physical, tangible tools to achieve that ({@link Trigger}s)</li>
 * </ul>
